# Docker-Docs_contexts-storage
This is to be used as a central hub where I can keep all of my tools for designing, building, and working with docker containers. Mainly it is for building up and storing PATH style contexts. Each will contain an associated dockerfile.When I want to build an image, I just clone the outer dir to local and build.
